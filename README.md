# Portenta-Pro-Community-Solutions
Portenta Pro Community Solutions and Links. 

Started March 20st 2021

# Install from the Arduino IDE library manager --> search for "Portenta", then install the "Portenta Pro Coummnity Solutions"

Install it as a standalone or with the few supporting libraries. Either way works fine.

## Goal


To find and maintain lots of example code and useful links that work with the Arduino Pro Portenta Series of Boards and Shields




It is expected that users will have some of the following:

Must have: $103.47 USD (Arduino PortentaH7)[https://store.arduino.cc/usa/portenta-h7] 

$47.15 USD (Ethernet Vision Shield)[https://store.arduino.cc/usa/portenta-vision-shield] 

$63.00 USD (LoRa Vision Shield)[https://store.arduino.cc/usa/portenta-vision-shield-lora]

$45.99 USD (Portenta Breakout board)[https://store.arduino.cc/usa/portenta-breakout]

Expensive but powerful.
